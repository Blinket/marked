# Playing Cards

A marble does not have an orientation. It [cannot be flipped][flipped] or
rotated. It always appears the same no matter how it's placed on the table.

## Getting Oriented

What if we wanted to calculate the total number of positions for a set of
**three playing cards**?

Playing cards, however, *do* have an orientation. We can flip any of the three
cards and we'll end up with a *different* position. In order to calculate the
total number of positions, we'll need to factor in **both the permutation and
orientation** of each card.

# How Large Is That?

There are over 43 quintillion legal positions of the Rubik's Cube.

- It would take **thirteen hundred million years** to see every position if you
  were able to view one thousand per second.
- If we stacked 43 quintillion pennies, the stack would be tall enough to reach
  the sun and return to the earth **four thousand billion times**.
